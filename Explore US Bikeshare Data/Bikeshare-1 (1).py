# ## Bike Share Data 
# <p><img style=" float: right ;margin: 5px 20px 5px 1px;" width="300" src="https://i.ibb.co/WxyFB3D/14581469364-fa154367d9-k.jpg"></p>
# Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.
# 
# Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.
# 
# In this project, I will use data provided by <a href="https://www.motivateco.com/"> Motivate</a>, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. I will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC
